Drag-and-Drop To-Do List

This is a simple, interactive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks dynamically and organize them across three columns: To Do, Doing, and Done. Users can easily drag and drop tasks between columns to visually manage their workflow.

Key Features:
Add new tasks using an input form

Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status

Responsive design with clear visual feedback on drag actions

Smooth user experience with task highlight on hover and drop zones

This project is perfect for beginners to practice DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop API, and event handling in JavaScript.
